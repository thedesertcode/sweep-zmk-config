TODO:
 * Separate layer to control connections over bluetooth and usb cable, so that they do not overlap with the working keys
 * Separate layer for RU language and punctuation
 * Place LCTRL and RCTRL mods under middle finger, because it's great place to make most common hotkey combinations
 * Add key for right-click menu
 * Add macro for CTRL+C, because now it's very difficult to do the copy task
 * Check combination Shift+F10 (was not worked under windows install)
 * Make mouse layer activation with press and hold behaviour
 * Instead of TAB on each side, one of the TAB keys can be used for different purpose
 * Letters Ж,Х and Э are used more frequently, than Ё and Ъ
 * Adjust mouse cursor speed
 * Adjust wait time on hold-tap behavior
 * Make separate hotkey to change connection mode to Bluetooth
 * Make separate hotkey to change connection mode to USB
 * Remove layer for Mac
 * Replace MCU to nice!nano v2
 * Change switches to Ambient Nocturnal (20g)
 * Calibrate Debouncer time
 * Improve language switch time by combo or macro. Make it separate
 * Improve ru lang layout, try with tap dance behavior
 * Improve using mouse layout. Try to move left/right movement to different halve
 * Learn how works tap dance behavior, think about using it for keyboard improvement
 * Slightly increase cursor speed
 * Move 0 digit to another key
 * Change dot on numpad to kp_dot
 * Change symbols layout for easier and faster use of most popular symbols (,:,/,-,:,"
 * Remove ESC from Q hold tap or change to tap dance
 * Simplify punctuation keys on ru layout, to use existing keys

 Improvements:
 * Delete key on the left side. (Adds ability to delete when using the mouse)
 * Understand the behavior of Repeat key
 * Reduce number of layers and combine that have only few functioncs
 * Pin the layer keys to the opposite side of the holded finger for more move freedom. Because when hold the key and trying to press another key with the same hand, it feels more constrained
 * + добавить русские буквы
 * + добавить переключение в режим цифр на правой половинке
 * + добавить кнопку контекстного меню
 * + добавить кнопки регулировки яркости
 * + добавить кнопку soft_off в слое макро
